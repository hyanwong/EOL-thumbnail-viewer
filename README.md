# EOL-thumbnail-viewer
A single page that shows a set of 'best' [Encyclopedia of Life](http://www.eol.org) thumbnails for a set of EoL page IDs

Download the html file and open it in a browser (I use Safari for OS X)

EoL page IDs for a set of taxa should be provided as CGI parameters, as in

view_EOL_pages.html?doID=1179566&doID=1180006&doID=7252447&doID=327857&doID=1178074&doID=1048803

For an example, follow "Try this link" which will append a set of serveral hundred page IDs for (mostly) vertebrate taxa to the page URL.
